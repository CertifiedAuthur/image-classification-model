# image-classification-model
Deployed mnist dataset image classification model on heroku

This project aimed to solve the issue of image classification using the mnist dataset.
The model was saved as mnist.pth and was deployed on the herokuapp. 

The web application was built using flask. 

It is important to note that the link to the deployed model is on the test.py, because there is no html used to create a landing page,
the model can only be tested on any code editor that supports .py format.
